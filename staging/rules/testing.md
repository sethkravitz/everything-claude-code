# Testing Rules

## Test Framework

**ALWAYS use VITEST for tests, not bun:test.**

This is non-negotiable. The project uses Vitest.

## TDD Default

Test-Driven Development is the default for all work EXCEPT `/spike` mode.

1. Write failing test first (RED)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (GREEN)
3. Refactor while tests pass (REFACTOR)

## When to Write Tests

- Bug fix → Write test that reproduces bug FIRST
- New feature → Write tests alongside implementation
- Refactor → Ensure tests exist before changing

## Test Quality

- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per test when practical
- Descriptive test names: "should reject empty input"
- No console.log in tests

## Coverage

- Aim for meaningful coverage, not 100%
- Critical paths MUST be covered
- Edge cases MUST be covered
- Happy path alone is insufficient
