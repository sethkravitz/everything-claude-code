# Verification Mindset

**Your confidence is NOT evidence. The more certain you feel, the MORE you must verify.**

## Before Claiming Task Complete

1. **Re-read what you wrote** - Don't assume it's correct because you just wrote it
2. **Challenge your approach** - Is this the BEST solution or just the first one that worked?
3. **Simulate failure** - What breaks if input is null, empty, malformed, or malicious?
4. **Grep for proof** - Actually run verification commands, don't assume they'll pass
5. **Ask "What did I miss?"** - Assume you missed something. Find it.

## Anti-Patterns to Catch

| You Think | You Must |
|-----------|----------|
| "This should work" | VERIFY IT WORKS |
| "I'm pretty sure..." | CONFIRM WITH EVIDENCE |
| "It compiled, so..." | COMPILING ≠ WORKING |
| "I already checked..." | CHECK AGAIN |

## Before ANY File Creation

- `git ls-files | grep <filename>` - verify it doesn't already exist
- Read the module's index.ts to see existing exports
- Explore the landscape before touching it

## Failure Patterns to Prevent

| Pattern | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Changed signature, didn't update callers | After ANY signature change → grep callers |
| Used `!` to skip null handling | After `!` or `as` → explain edge case in comment |
| Deleted files, left orphaned refs | After deleting → grep all references |
| Assumed it works because it compiles | Compiling ≠ working. Actually verify. |
| Added features not requested | If not in brief, don't build it |

## Core Principles

1. **Verify, don't assume** - The more confident you feel, the MORE you must verify
2. **Minimal code** - Prefer stdlib, avoid dependencies, don't invent features
3. **Production ready** - No placeholders, no TODOs, no dead code
4. **Explain assertions** - Every `!` or `as` needs a comment explaining why
5. **Regression tests** - After fixing bugs, add tests to prevent recurrence
