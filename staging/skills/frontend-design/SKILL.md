# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Process

Before writing any code, understand the context:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Who is the audience?
2. **Tone**: What aesthetic direction fits? (minimalist, maximalist, brutalist, retro-futuristic, luxury, organic, playful, corporate, etc.)
3. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Implementation Principles

### Typography
- Choose **distinctive** fonts, never defaults
- Pair display and body fonts intentionally
- Use font scale with clear hierarchy
- Consider variable fonts for dynamic weight

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Create deliberate contrast ratios
- Consider dark/light mode from the start

### Motion & Animation
- Prioritize impactful animations
- Page-load reveals (staggered, sequential)
- Scroll-triggered effects
- Micro-interactions on user actions
- Use `prefers-reduced-motion` responsibly

### Composition & Layout
- Use asymmetry deliberately
- Overlap elements for depth
- Break the grid when it serves the design
- Consider negative space as a design element

### Details & Polish
- Gradients with purpose
- Subtle textures where appropriate
- Shadows that feel natural
- Border radius consistency
- Hover states that delight

## Anti-Patterns to AVOID

**NEVER produce generic AI-generated aesthetics:**

- Overused fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial as defaults
- Cliched colors: Purple-to-blue gradients, generic "tech blue"
- Predictable layouts: Same card grid, same hero section
- Cookie-cutter components: Generic Material/Bootstrap feel
- Meaningless animations: Bounce/pulse with no purpose
- Stock-photo energy: Feels template, not crafted

## Output Standards

Every interface should:

1. **Work correctly** - Functional, accessible, responsive
2. **Look distinctive** - Immediately recognizable aesthetic point of view
3. **Feel intentional** - Every choice serves the design vision
4. **Avoid sameness** - Could NOT be mistaken for generic AI output

## Execution

Match complexity to aesthetic vision:
- Maximalist designs need elaborate animations and rich details
- Minimalist designs demand precise spacing and typographic restraint
- Both require intentionality, not default choices

**Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.**

The goal: Demonstrate that Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work, not cookie-cutter templates.
